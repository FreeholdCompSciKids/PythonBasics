### Comments <a name="comments"/>

Everything in your python program that is not marked as a comment using `#` 
will be read by Python as python code.
In this cheatsheet you will find a lot of short 
code snippets and sometime we will use comments to explain them

```python
print 3+4             # prints 12
```

So here `print 3+4` is interpreted as python code and `# prints 12` 
is a comment that is meant as an explanation for the programmer.
