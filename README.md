### Comments <a name="comments"/>

Everything in your python program that is not marked as a comment using `#` will be read by Python as python code.
In this cheatsheet you will find a lot of short code snippets and sometime we will use comments to explain them

```python
print 3+4             # prints 12
```

So here `print 3+4` is interpreted as python code and `# prints 12` is a comment that is meant as an explanation for the programmer.

------------------------------------------------------------

### Data Types <a name="data_types"/>
Python support different data types and is able to convert back an forth between them.

##### Strings <a name="data_types__strings"/>
Strings are used to represent text. 

```python
"Hello World"
'This is also text'
"123"                 # This is a string, NOT a number
```
Strings can be concatenated (= writing one afte the other) using the `+` operator.

```python
"I love " + "chocolate"    # = "I love chocoloate"
"i" + "c" + "e" + "cream"  # = "icecream"  
"100"+"23"                 # = "10023" (because "100" and "23" are strings, 
                           #            not numbers so we are concatenating, not adding)
```
It is possible to convert data that is not a string into a string using the `str()` function. 
This maybe be needed when concatenating a string with the result of a numberical computation.

```python
"xyz" + str(3*4)    # = xyz12  (it first computes 3*4, which is 12 as number, 
                    #           then converts it into a string for concatenation )
```

##### Numbers <a name="data_types__numbers"/>


##### Booleans <a name="data_types__booleans"/>

------------------------------------------------------------

### Input and Output <a name="io"/>

##### Input
We can use the `print` function to print output 

```python
    print "Hello World"   #prints the text:         Hello World
    print 3+4             #print the value of 3+4:  12 
    print 3+4, 3*4        #print the value of 3+4 followed by the value of 3*4:  7 12
```

##### Output
We can use the function `raw_input` to read input from the user.
```python 
    name = raw_input("What is your name? ")
```

:warning: **Important:** `raw_input()` reads the user input as a string. If you need it as a number, you have to convert it
```python 
    age = int(raw_input("What is your name? "))
    age = float(raw_input("What is the price of gasonline? "))
```

------------------------------------------------------------


### Variables <a name="variables"/>

We use variable to store data that we want to access at a later point. 
In python we can just use a new name that we have not used before and assign a value to it and it becomes a variable.

```python
age = 12
name = "Bob'
```
